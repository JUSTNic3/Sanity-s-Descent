                The player lives through the protagonist's everyday life from the moment he wakes up, until he goes to sleep. During the gameplay, some things will start to subtly
                change until the point of no return at which the player is trapped and has to do everything in his power to get out alive. Once trapped, the player will face 3 entities
                that resemble his bosses and each have a different quirk. Player has to find a way to deal with each of them accordingly and find items useful for his escape while the
                reality around him crumbles.
